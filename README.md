# UdditSocialNewsAggregator

Udiddit, a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website, 
was using a risky and unreliable Postgres database schema to store the forum 
posts, discussions, and votes made by their users about different topics. In this
project new realiable schema was created and then migration of the databse to the 
newly created schema.
